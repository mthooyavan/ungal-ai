# Ungal.ai Application Development Overview

This document provides a high-level plan with step-by-step processes to build the MVP version of **ungal.ai**, our ChatGPT-like application using Rust, Docker, and other technologies.

## Backend

### 1. User Authentication

- [ ] **Plan User Registration and Login**
    - Determine authentication requirements and workflow.
    - Choose password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, argon2).
- [ ] **Set Up Session Management**
    - Decide on using JWTs for stateless authentication.
- [ ] **Integrate Authentication Middleware**
    - Plan middleware implementation with `axum` to protect routes.
    - Define route guard strategies.

### 2. AI Model Integration

- [ ] **Design Abstraction Layer for AI Models**
    - List AI models to integrate.
    - Outline methods for dynamic model switching.
- [ ] **Plan Asynchronous Communication**
    - Use `tokio` for handling async requests to AI models.
    - Ensure non-blocking operations.
- [ ] **Establish Error Handling Procedures**
    - Define error handling strategies for AI model interactions.
    - Plan for retries and fallbacks.

### 3. HTTP API Endpoints

- [ ] **Define API Structure with `axum` and `hyper`**
    - Outline all necessary endpoints.
    - Map endpoints to application features.
- [ ] **Implement Endpoints**
    - **Authentication:**
        - `/register`, `/login`, `/logout`
    - **Conversations:**
        - `/conversations` (GET, POST)
        - `/conversations/{id}` (GET)
        - `/conversations/{id}/messages` (GET, POST)
    - **AI Models:**
        - `/models` (GET)
        - `/models/switch` (POST)
- [ ] **Plan Middleware and Routing**
    - Set up logging, authentication, and error handling middleware.
    - Organize routes logically.

### 4. Asynchronous Request Handling

- [ ] **Ensure Non-blocking Operations**
    - Use async/await syntax throughout the codebase.
- [ ] **Manage Concurrency**
    - Utilize `tokio` features for concurrent processing.
- [ ] **Optimize Performance**
    - Identify potential bottlenecks.
    - Plan for load testing and tuning.

## Database

### 1. Conversation Storage

- [ ] **Set Up PostgreSQL Database**
    - Use Docker to run PostgreSQL service.
    - Configure database credentials and access.
- [ ] **Define Database Schema**
    - Plan tables for users, conversations, and messages.
    - Determine relationships and constraints.
- [ ] **Implement Data Access Layer**
    - Outline CRUD operations for each table.
    - Plan prepared statements and query optimizations.
- [ ] **Plan Asynchronous Database Operations**
    - Use `sqlx` with `tokio` for async interactions.
- [ ] **Ensure Data Integrity and Security**
    - Plan input validation and sanitation.
    - Set up proper indexing and constraints.

## Frontend

### 1. Frontend Design

- [ ] **Select Frontend Framework**
    - Use **React.js** for building the UI.
- [ ] **Design UI Components**
    - Sketch layouts for chat interface, authentication pages, and dashboards.
- [ ] **Determine State Management Strategy**
    - Decide between React Context API or libraries like Redux.
- [ ] **Plan API Integration**
    - Organize API service layers for backend communication.
    - Manage authentication tokens securely.
- [ ] **Design Model Switching Interface**
    - Create UI elements for selecting and switching AI models.
- [ ] **Ensure Responsive Design**
    - Plan for mobile-first design principles.
    - Utilize responsive units and media queries.

## Additional Notes

- **Error Handling and Validation**
    - Standardize error messages and user feedback mechanisms.
- **Security Considerations**
    - Implement measures against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- **Logging and Monitoring**
    - Set up logging systems for both frontend and backend.
    - Plan monitoring tools for application performance.
